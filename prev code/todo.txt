audio:
- get specific about mixing needs:
    - split recording to stereo mixing to allow diff mix for each ear
    - assign r-ear and l-ear mix to match embedded chart values

chart functionality:
- last thing to do is make sure that sliders react as soon as data is present on chart (currently waiting for user to drag and adjust)

app logistics:
- migrate app to React
- set up database to hold user info and save user sound settings
-
